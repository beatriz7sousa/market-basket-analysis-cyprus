DOUBTS Q&A:
- there are some products that have TotalAmount variable as 0. should we consider it as an offer to the client? YES, IGNORE IT.

- if the lift is near 1, that is the expected behaviour. so, if the lift is lower than 1, it means that the products are substitutes, in the sense that when the consequent is present is not probable that the antecedent will be also present.

- maximum and minimum of the price of products

- DIVIDE THE DATASET BY WEATHER, OR LOWER THE SUPPORT VALUE TO FIND RULES FOR THAT
